The idea behind the project is to create popular and effective **Flutter UI elements** (even fullscreen layouts) that you can use in your next project or simply learn some new tricks when it comes to animations and structuring.

The source code is **100% Dart** and in most cases does not rely on any third party library or package except for support for SVG files where needed.

## Requirements

- Any Operating System (ie. MacOS, Linux, Windows)
- Any IDE with Flutter SDK installed (ie. IntelliJ, Android Studio, VSCode, etc)
- A basic knowledge of Dart and Flutter
