![Flutter UI Gems](./assets/images/FlutterUIGems.png)

The idea behind the project is to create popular and effective **Flutter UI elements** (even fullscreen layouts) that you can use in your next project or simply learn some new tricks for animations and structuring.

The source code is **100% Dart** and, in most cases, does not rely on any third-party library or package except for support for SVG files where needed.

## Requirements

- Any Operating System (ie. MacOS, Linux, Windows)
- Any IDE with Flutter SDK installed (ie. IntelliJ, Android Studio, VSCode, etc)
- A basic knowledge of Dart and Flutter
